Period: 2024-04-04 - 2024-04-06

Status: Accepted

***

## Goal
Select an end-to-end testing framework for an AI-powered website that generates learning mind maps, focusing on dynamic content testing, visual accuracy, and TypeScript support.

## Limitations
- **Time**: The decision must support keeping the team on schedule with the project timeline.

- **Resources**: Limit to current TypeScript expertise and available documentation.

- **Scope**: Focus on TypeScript-compatible frameworks suitable for dynamic, visual testing.

## Options Explored
- **Cypress**: Noted for ease of use, documentation, plugins, and strong community support. Offers direct TypeScript support.

- **Playwright**: Offers comprehensive browser coverage; higher initial learning curve. Offers direct TypeScript support.

- **Selenium**: Versatile, wide browser support, but complex and less integrated with modern workflows.

## Challenges
- Testing dynamic, AI-generated content.
- Ensuring visual accuracy of mind maps.
- Minimizing the learning curve for new tools.

## Decision
Cypress is recommended for its quick setup, direct TypeScript support, visual testing capabilities through plugins, strong community support, and seamless CI/CD integration.
