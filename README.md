# Welcome to Linkta's Sandbox

Welcome to Linkta's Sandbox! This repository is our playground for exploring new ideas and possibilities. Here, we encourage experimentation and a lightweight approach to innovation. If you have a new idea or a better way of doing something, we want to see it! Submit a pull request and share your thoughts in the discussion field.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## How to Use This Repository

### Development

This command leverages concurrent execution to allow you to see your changes in real-time.

### Build

```npm run build```
This command prepares your application for deployment by optimizing both ends.
