## Constraints and Limitations

### Technical Constraints:
- **Tech Stack Integration:** Selected technologies must integrate seamlessly for low latency, high scalability, and robust security.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The system should be designed to support both web and potential future mobile applications, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.

### Resource Constraints:
- **Development Efficiency:** The development process must be efficient, leveraging the team's existing expertise with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack within the constraints of a limited budget and timeline.
- **Budget Limitations:** Due to financial constraints, strategic feature prioritization and efficient resource allocation are necessary to deliver a high-quality product within the allocated budget.

### Market Constraints:
- **Competitive Advantage:** To stand out in a competitive market, the Linkta system should offer unique features or superior performance compared to existing solutions.
- **Future Enhancements:** The system should be designed to accommodate future enhancements, including the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) post-MVP, to enhance data processing and user interaction capabilities.

## System Architecture
Linkta follows a client-server model with a frontend built on TypeScript, React, and various libraries, and a backend built using Node.js, Express, Redis, and MongoDB. The frontend communicates with the backend through a RESTful API. Firebase Authentication is used for user authentication and authorization. The system is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Firebase Hosting.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, React Flow, Zustand, React Query, Firebase Authentication
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Redis, MongoDB
- **AI Provider:** Gemini (version TBD)
- **DevOps/Infrastructure:** GCP, Firebase Hosting, GitHub Actions, Git
- **Testing:** Jest, Cypress
- **Other:** Zod
- **Pending decisions:** Choice of notification library (React Toastify/React Hot Toast), logging library (Winston/Sentry), and monitoring and alerting tools

## Data Models and Database Design
The main entities include:
- **User:** Represents a user of the system, storing information such as ID, email, name, settings, and creation timestamp.
- **Prompt Meta:** Stores metadata related to a user's submitted prompt, including ID, user ID, original prompt, associated tree ID, and creation timestamp.
- **Prompt Data:** Stores the processed and optimized prompt data, including ID, associated prompt meta ID, engineered prompt, and LLM response.
- **Tree:** Represents a learning tree, storing information such as ID, user ID, name, root node ID, creation timestamp, and last update timestamp.
- **Node:** Represents a node within a learning tree, storing information such as ID, associated tree ID, parent ID, content, creation timestamp, and last update timestamp.

The detailed field-level information for each entity can be found in the "Data Models" section of the [Linkta API Design" documentation](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/TCClWhuYjciANvj4k9Ab) and the [data models ER diagrams](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/EJ7k7P8yiDQCqBUsEdoI).

## API Design
The Linkta API follows a REST architecture and uses JSON format for requests and responses. The API endpoints are categorized into the following main groups:

- **Authentication:** Handles user authentication and session management, including login and logout.
- **Prompt Submission and Augmentation:** Allows users to submit prompts, processes them, and generates tree structures.
- **Tree Management:** Provides endpoints for retrieving, updating, and deleting trees and their associated nodes.
- **User Management:** Handles user-related operations such as updating user settings and deleting user accounts.
The detailed API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements can be found in the [Linkta API Design documentation](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/TCClWhuYjciANvj4k9Ab).

- **Data Privacy:** The system will be designed to comply with relevant data privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA.
- **Rate Limiting:** Rate limiting mechanisms will be implemented to prevent abuse and protect against excessive requests.
- **Secure Communication:** HTTPS will be used for all client-server communications to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

## Testing Strategy
The testing strategy for Linkta includes:
- **Unit Testing:** Individual components and modules will be tested using Jest to ensure they function as expected in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Integration tests will be performed to verify the proper functioning of component interactions and workflows.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Cypress will be used for end-to-end testing to simulate user interactions and validate the system's behavior from the user's perspective.
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** GitHub Actions will be utilized to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.

## Deployment and DevOps
Linkta will be deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Firebase Hosting for the frontend and GCP services for the backend. The deployment process will be automated using GitHub Actions, enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
