# React Naming Conventions Guide

This guide highlights the importance of naming conventions in React, emphasizing their role in fostering clean, readable, and maintainable codebases. Adopting consistent naming conventions enhances code readability, simplifies maintenance, and facilitates effective communication within development teams.

## Key Naming Conventions:

### PascalCase
#### Use For:
- **React Components:** Define components with the first letter of each word capitalized.
  ```
  const TodoList = () => {};
  ```

- **CSS Class Files:** Name your CSS, SCSS, or CSS module files using PascalCase.
  ```
    // Example filenames
    TodoList.css
    TodoList.scss
    TodoList.module.scss
    ```

- **Enumerations:** Define enums with each word capitalized.
  ```
  const RequestStatus = { NEW: 'new', IN_PROGRESS: 'inProgress' };
  ```

### camelCase
#### Use For:
- **Variable Names:** Start variable names with a lowercase letter, followed by capitalized words.
  ```
  const userName = "janeDoe";
  ```

- **Function Names:** Functions should follow the same pattern as variables.
  ```
  const calculateAge = (birthYear) => {};
  ```

- **Object Properties:** Keep object keys in camelCase.
  ```
  const user = { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" };
  ```

- **CSS Module Class Names:** Define class names in camelCase within CSS Modules.
  ```
  .headerContainer { display: flex; }
  ```

- **Custom Hooks & Higher-Order Components:** Prefix custom hooks with `use` and HOCs with `with`.
  ```
  // custom hook
  const useTodo = () => {
  //...
  }

  // HOC
  // "Filter" is add as Suffix which is original component
  const withFilter = () => {
  //...
  }

  // Usage of the HOC
  const Filter = withFilter(/*Component Name*/);
  ```

### kebab-case
#### Use For:
- **CSS Class Names:** When defining class names directly in CSS.
  ```
  .header-container {
    display: flex;
  }

  <div className="header-container">
  //...
  </div>
  ```

- **Folder Names:** Organize related files into folders named in kebab-case.
  ```
  src/
    todo-list/
    todo-item/
  ```

### SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
#### Use For:
- **Constants:** Define constants in all uppercase, with underscores between words.
  ```
  const BASE_PATH = 'https://example.com/api';
  ```

- **Enumeration Properties:** Enum keys should follow the same convention.
  ```
  const RequestType = {
  // Name in Pascal Case
  // Properties in Screaming Snake Case
  GET: 'GET',
  POST: 'POST',
  PUT: 'PUT',
  DELETE: 'DELETE',
  };
  ```
- **Global Variables:**
  ```
  const ENVIRONMENT = 'PRODUCTION';
  const PI = 3.14159;
  ```

## Best Practices
- **Descriptive Names:** Avoid generic names to improve clarity and maintainability.
  ```
  ✅ Best Practice

  const ProductDetails = () => {

  const productInfo = fetchProductInfo();
  // Fetches detailed product information

  const addProductToCart = () => {
    // Add the product to the shopping cart
  };
  //...
  }
  ```

- **Singular vs. Plural Naming:** Choose based on the context—singular for individual items and plural for collections.
  ```
  ✅ Best Practice

  const fetchConversation = () => {
    // Fetch single conversation.
  }

  const fetchConversations = () => {
    // Fetch multiple conversations.
  }
  ```

- **Avoid Excessive Abbreviations:** Prefer full, descriptive names over abbreviated ones.
  ```
  ✅ Best Practice

  // Descriptive object and property names
  const selectedUser = {
    userId: 1,
    userName: 'Jane Doe',
    userEmail: 'jane-doe@domain.com',
  }

  // Usage
  selectedUser.userId
  ```

By adhering to these conventions, developers can create more readable, maintainable, and consistent codebases in React applications.
